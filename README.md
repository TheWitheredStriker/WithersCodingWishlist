# Wither's Coding Wishlist

A repository detailed to documenting stuff I want to code one day, sorted by difficulty. Programming language is appended to the list.

# Doable for a beginner

- [ ] A random insult generator that pulls from a database of words. (__TBD__)
- [ ] A transliteration tool to convert languages between alphabets. (__Perl__)
- [ ] A simple game wherein we simply move a cube over a basic floor and jump. I want to try this in all sorts of different programming languages.
- [ ] A simple Windows GUI application. (__Visual Basic.NET__)
- [ ] Another simple Windows GUI application. (__F#__)
- [ ] A simple Delphi application. (__Pascal__)
- [ ] Yet another simple Windows GUI application, with Visual D. (__D__)

# Medium

- [ ] A basic mobile app for Android. (__Kotlin__)
- [ ] A basic mobile app for iOS / iPadOS. (__Swift__)
- [ ] A simple server that does nothing too special, it just works. (__NodeJS__ or maybe __Go__)
- [ ] A simple Windows GUI application with Ada for .NET. (__Ada__)
- [ ] A Discord bot. (__[Dart](https://github.com/nyxx-discord/nyxx)__ or __[Julia](https://github.com/Xh4H/Discord.jl)__)
- [ ] A simple 3D horror game with Unity Arcadia. (__[Clojure](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia)__)
- [ ] Some Unity games using __F#__ and __Visual Basic.NET__, built into DLL's.
- [ ] A custom gamemode for _Garry's Mod_, developed for a group of friends as client work. (__Lua__)

# Hard

- [ ] A simple C++Builder application. (__C++__)
- [ ] A Minecraft modded anarchy server. (__Scala__)
- [ ] A Minecraft death animation mod. (__Scala__ or __Clojure__)
- [ ] A run and gun video game. (__TBD__)
- [ ] A much more sophisticated 3D horror game with Unity Arcadia. (__Clojure__)
- [ ] The aforementioned iOS app that I made with Swift, but now rewritten in __Objective-C__.
- [ ] A GTA V mod, details TBD. (__Lua__ or __C#__)
- [ ] A UE4 game with AngelScript. (__AngelScript__)
- [ ] A UE4 game with Unreal.hx. (__Haxe__)
- [ ] A UE4 game with Unreal.js. (__JavaScript__)
- [ ] A UE4 game with the standard language. (__C++__)
- [ ] A UE4 horror game. (__C++__, __Haxe__, __AngelScript__ or __JavaScript__, haven't decided yet)
- [ ] A Heaps.io game. (__Haxe__)
- [ ] A Slender Man game. (__Clojure__)
- [ ] A Dev Wiki script to let users embed Steam profiles, groups, store pages, Workshop items, etc into Fandom pages. (__JavaScript__)

# Madman

- [ ] A Minecraft RPG mod. (__Scala__ or __Clojure__)
- [ ] A simple OS (with kernel and drivers) that only does one thing: it lets you play PAC-MAN. (__C__ / __Assembly__)
- [ ] A PC Engine / TurboGrafx emulator. (__TBD__)
- [ ] A simple video editing application. (__Clojure__)
- [ ] An open-source platform fighter, a la "_Super Smash Bros._ meets _M.U.G.E.N_" (__Haxe__)
- [ ] An open-source Counter-Strike-ish game (__TBD__)

# I lost my fucking mind please send help

- [ ] A ROM hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. (__Assembly__)
- [ ] The aforementioned PAC-MAN OS, but written in __Zig__.
- [ ] A simple digital audio workstation. (__Clojure__)
- [ ] A moddable voxel game in the likes of Minecraft. (Probably __Clojure__, __Scala__ or __F#__)

# OH GOD I'M STUCK ON THE MOON HELP ME

- [ ] At some point in the _really_ far future, a __very__ simple MMORPG-ish game, and then I mean VERY simple. (__TBD__)
- [ ] A heavily modified Minecraft server, sporting both survival and minigames, with a variety of mods and plugins. (__Scala__)
- [ ] A method to allow ROM hacking retro games in a high-performance programming language other than ASM (and to convert disassemblies to and from said languages), like Nim, Julia, C, etc as well as maybe some other languages like Lisp.

As you can probably tell, I really like Clojure so far lol
