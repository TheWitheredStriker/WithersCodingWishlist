# Wither's Coding Wishlist

A repository detailed to documenting stuff I want to code one day, sorted by difficulty. Programming language is appended to the list.

# Doable for a beginner

- A random insult generator that pulls from a database of words. (__TBD__)
- A transliteration tool to convert languages between alphabets. (__Perl__)
- A simple game wherein we simply move a cube over a basic floor and jump. I want to try this in all sorts of different programming languages.

# Medium

- A basic mobile app for Android. (__Kotlin__)
- A basic mobile app for iOS / iPadOS. (__Swift__)
- A simple server that does nothing too special, it just works. (__NodeJS__ or maybe __Go__)
- A Discord bot. (__[Dart](https://github.com/nyxx-discord/nyxx)__ or __[Julia](https://github.com/Xh4H/Discord.jl)__)
- A simple 3D horror game with Unity Arcadia. (__[Clojure](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia)__)
- Some Unity games using __F#__ and __Visual Basic.NET__, built into DLL's.
- A custom gamemode for _Garry's Mod_, developed for a group of friends as client work. (__Lua__)

# Hard

- A Minecraft modded anarchy server. (__Scala__)
- A run and gun video game. (__TBD__)
- A much more sophisticated 3D horror game with Unity Arcadia. (__Clojure__)
- That same iOS app in Swift, but rewritten in __Objective-C__.

# Madman

- A Minecraft RPG mod. (__Scala__ or __Clojure__)

# Wither lost his fucking mind please send help

- A ROM hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. (__Assembly__)
