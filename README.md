# Wither's Coding Wishlist

Essentially a "to do list" of stuff I want to eventually get done. Some projects are easier than the other, but a select few are much more ambitious.

- [ ] A powerful, low-level, 2D/3D game engine known as __Tempest__, built hand in hand with my own game ideas. (__Object Pascal__)

- [ ] An improved and extended version of [DynRPG](https://github.com/CherryDT/DynRPG), [its fork](https://github.com/rewrking/DynRPG), and its assorted [Lua scripting engine](https://github.com/kyuu/dynrpg-rpgss) that works with official (non-pirated) releases of RPG Maker 2003 and 2000. The current version only works with fan translated versions of 2k3, having been developed before it was officially released on Steam in 2015. This Steam release updated the runtime and thus broke compatibility with DynRPG. (__C++__)

- [ ] An up-to-date fork of [Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia), which has been abandoned by its developers and was left to rot. (__Clojure__/__C#__)

- [ ] A functional, modern REPL for Minecraft. (__Clojure__)

- [ ] A modern Visual Studio plugin (2017/19/22) for the programming language [Boo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo_(programming_language)). Should work hand-in-hand with Boo's upcoming .NET Core compiler, currently under development by Mason Wheeler. (TBD .NET language, likely __Boo__ itself)

- [ ] Modern, up-to-date forks of [BetterNether-Reforged](https://github.com/Someone-Else-Was-Taken/BetterNether-Reforged) and [BetterEndForge](https://github.com/Beethoven92/BetterEndForge). BetterNether's Forge port in particular is broken, having bugs with its terrain generation that need fixing. Both of them are currently written in Java, but I would rewrite them in __Kotlin__ using tools provided by JetBrains, in order to make the code more maintainable.

- [ ] Similarly to Mason's Boo efforts, I wish to breathe new life into [Nemerle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemerle). A .NET Core compiler exists, but has not been merged into the language repository (despite there having been a pull request to do this for over a year). At this point, I believe it's time for a fork (which incorporates the new compiler), which I would make as soon as I know my around around compiler development. Other planned features so far are a new Visual Studio extension (a la Boo) and a rewrite of the off-side syntax (which currently has some weird quirks), more akin to that of Scala 3. And of course, I could eventually add new language features. (__Nemerle__/__C#__)

- [ ] A Minecraft project that implements Fabric and Quilt on top of Minecraft Forge, so that hopefully we can finally do away with the tribal "Forge vs Fabric" mentality and use one loader/API for all mods. Essentially Patchwork, but the other way around (Fabric -> Forge instead of Forge -> Fabric). (__Scala__ or __Kotlin__)

- [ ] A GBA game using [Rath](https://github.com/stuij/rath). (__Forth__)
